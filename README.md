# Rank The Sort

## Intro

This repository will be used as a playing-ground to test different sorting algorithms.

The main ranking criteria will be speed, but the main objective is to understand the advantages and disadvantages of each one of them.

The project will also implement some, yet undefined, benchmark method and discuss its suitability in this context.

There will be some overhead because of the chosen language and because of some over-design, given that we are talking about a small scale of the project that will try to implement best-practices more appropriated for more complex applications. 

## Working method

A TDD - Test Driven Design - will be implemented to control the usability of each algorithm.

## Optional

Some kind of visualization tool could be added to help the understanding of the *mechanics* of each algorithm.
